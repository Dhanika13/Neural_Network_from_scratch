# Neural Network from scratch using Python

This project has an objective to create a simple code of Machine Learning algorithm from scratch in OOP style. I choose Neural Network algorithm for this project.  

## What is Neural Network?

Neural Network is one of the popular algorithms in Machine Learning which are inspired by organic brains. This model consists of interconnected nodes, known as neurons, organized into layers. Each neuron receives input signals, performs computations on them, and produces an output signal. The network's structure is typically divided into three main types of layers: input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.
